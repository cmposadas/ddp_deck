## Motivation for Exploring Drivers in Price of Diamonds

Someone who is looking to purchase diamonds would benefit
from understanding how certain characteristics impact the
price of a diamond

---

## Diamond Characteristics

```Rmd
Diamonds have 4 main characteristics called the 4 C's:
1. Carats
2. Cut
3. Clarity
4. Color

---

## What the App Does

The app will explore how cut, clarity and color impact the price (per carat) of diamonds using boxplots and the 'diamonds' dataset in R.

The 'diamonds' dataset contains the prices and other characteristics of about 54,000 diamonds.

---

## App Example: Impact of Cut on Price Per Carat
# This is what the app will display if we select 'Cut':
```{r plot, echo=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
data("diamonds")
ggplot(diamonds, aes(x = cut, y = price / carat, fill = cut)) + 
        geom_boxplot() + xlab("Cut") + ylab("Price per Carat") + theme(legend.position="none")
```
